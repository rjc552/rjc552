  <blockquote style= "font-size: 30px" >
    " Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only <br/>
    most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves.  <br/>
    The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed is female.  <br/>
    Thus she turns herself into an object of vision: a sight."
