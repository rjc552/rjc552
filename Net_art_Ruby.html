<h1>The Dollie Clone Series</h1>

        <p>
            The Dollie Clones were based off of the artist, Hershman Leeson's alter ego's: Roberta Breitmore and her evil twin "Tillie"
            Hershman wanted to convey the themes of surveillance and identity in this project. What I found fascinating is that this project
            conveys the early anxiety about dual identity in realtion to technology, as well as the fear of being watched by technology. Today,
            social media has given rise to these two conversations.
            <br><br>
            When it comes to identity, the dollie clones were crafted using specific details from the artists face. Part of the art peice was that the 
            dolls themselves were used in applications for subsciptions, credit cards, etc. Today, we use our emails, social media handles, and other digital "identities" to
            fullfill common activities, which was refelcted and predeicted in this 1970's work.
            <br><br>
            The theme of surveillance is one that modern society is grappling with. Our use of online platforms gives companies access to huge amount of our personal information.
            Our searches, likes, views, and other digital activity is used against us to predict what we will do next, and hopefull control us (into buying or doing somthing).
            The Dollie clones play with the idea of watching while being watched. Visitors can control the head of the doll, and thus where the camera points. We see what the doll sees, and this makes
            us feel as though we are the ones watching. However, at the same time, the doll is built to watch us. Neither us or the doll has full control of the perspective,
            we look at each other, and through each others eyes. This is similar to how we use technology today, because the more we watch, read, or consume digital information, the more our personal information
            is digitized!
